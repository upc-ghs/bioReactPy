# bioReactPy
A simulation tool for bio-reactive flow in porous media.

BioReactPy currently has the following features:

- Discretization of the Stokes equations of flow;

- Coupled flow and reactive transport, based on the microcontinuum approach;

- Fully coupled reactive transport and biomass-nutrient growth treated with Monod equation.

For more information, see the provided benchmarks and application tests.

BioReactPy is developed by Michele Starnoni, Hydrogeology Group (GHS) at the Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya (UPC), Barcelona, Spain. The software is developed under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement No. 101063414 – CO2FOREARM Fundamental study of CO2 storage through microbially enhanced carbon mineralization.
