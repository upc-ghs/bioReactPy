# bioReactPy
A simulation tool for bio-reactive flow in porous media

BioReactPy currently has the following features:
Discretization of the Stokes equations of flow:
Standard Finite-Volume implementation of the no-slip condition
Finite-Volume Microcontinuum approach
Coupled flow and reactive transport, based on the microcontinuum approach:
First-order implementation of the kinetic term
Fully resolved geochemical speciation
Fully coupled reactive transport and biomass-nutrient growth treated with Monod equation
For more information, see the provided examples and application tests.
BioReactPy is developed by Michele Starnoni, Hydrogeology Group (GHS) at the Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya (UPC), Barcelona, Spain. The software is developed under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement No. 101063414 â€“ CO2FOREAM Fundamental study of CO2 storage through microbially enhanced carbon mineralization.
